                <p>
                    According to Global estimates, published by WHO,
                    about 35% women worldwide experience violence
                    at least once in their lifetimes. This is why we designed
                    an interactive app to point out the safe routes
                    for people walking back to home at night alone.

                <h2>Real-Time Age Estimation System Based on Convolutionla Neural Network</h2>
                <p>
                    The demand for automatic face detection and age recognition has become
                    increasingly significant for the social media industry and the whole society.
                    Most of the previous age estimation models are based on the presumption that
                    the input images for their models are facial images of human.
                    In the real-world scenario, however, the input might not be qualified enough.
                    Moreover, their estimation performance is yet to be improved.
                    Therefor we worked on improving the age estimation technology.
